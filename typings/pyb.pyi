        16 bits or greater.  If ``buf`` has only 8-bit elements (eg a bytearray) then
        the sample resolution will be reduced to 8 bits.

        ``timer`` should be a Timer object, and a sample is read each time the timer

        This is a static method. It can be used to extract relative timing or
        phase data from multiple ADC's.

        It reads analog values from multiple ADC's into buffers at a rate set by
        the *timer* object. Each time the timer triggers a sample is rapidly
        read from each ADC in turn.

        ADC and buffer instances are passed in tuples with each ADC having an
        associated buffer. All buffers must be of the same type and length and
        the number of buffers must equal the number of ADC's.

        Buffers can be ``bytearray`` or ``array.array`` for example. The ADC values
        have 12-bit resolution and are stored directly into the buffer if its element
        size is 16 bits or greater.  If buffers have only 8-bit elements (eg a
        ``bytearray``) then the sample resolution will be reduced to 8 bits.

        *timer* must be a Timer object. The timer must already be initialised
        and running at the desired sampling frequency.

        Example reading 3 ADC's::

            adc0 = pyb.ADC(pyb.Pin.board.X1)    # Create ADC's
            adc1 = pyb.ADC(pyb.Pin.board.X2)

            rx1 = array.array('H', (0 for i in range(100))) # 100 16-bit words
            rx2 = array.array('H', (0 for i in range(100)))
            # read analog values into buffers at 100Hz (takes one second)
            pyb.ADC.read_timed_multi((adc0, adc1, adc2), (rx0, rx1, rx2), tim)
            for n in range(len(rx0)):
                print(rx0[n], rx1[n], rx2[n])

        This function does not allocate any heap memory. It has blocking behaviour:
        it does not return to the calling program until the buffers are full.

        The function returns ``True`` if all samples were acquired with correct
        timing. At high sample rates the time taken to acquire a set of samples
        can exceed the timer period. In this case the function returns ``False``,
        indicating a loss of precision in the sample interval. In extreme cases
        samples may be missed.

        The maximum rate depends on factors including the data width and the
        number of ADC's being read. In testing two ADC's were sampled at a timer
        rate of 210kHz without overrun. Samples were missed at 215kHz.  For three
        ADC's the limit is around 140kHz, and for four it is around 110kHz.
        At high sample rates disabling interrupts for the duration can reduce the
        risk of sporadic data loss.

          - An array containing the data.

        If *list* is ``None`` then a new tuple will be allocated, as well as a new
        bytes object to contain the data (as the fourth element in the tuple).

        If *list* is not ``None`` then it should be a list object with a least four
        elements.  The fourth element should be a memoryview object which is created
        from either a bytearray or an array of type 'B' or 'b', and this array must
        have enough room for at least 8 bytes.  The list object will then be
        populated with the first three return values above, and the memoryview object
        will be resized inplace to the size of the data and filled in with that data.
        The same list and memoryview objects can be reused in subsequent calls to
        this method, providing a way of receiving data without using the heap.
        For example::

             buf = bytearray(8)
             lst = [0, 0, 0, memoryview(buf)]
             # No heap memory is allocated in the following call

        Keyword arguments:

            - ``Timer.OC_INACTIVE`` --- the pin will be made inactive when a compare match occurs.
            - ``Timer.OC_TOGGLE`` --- the pin will be toggled when an compare match occurs.
            - ``Timer.OC_FORCED_ACTIVE`` --- the pin is forced active (compare match is ignored).
            - ``Timer.OC_FORCED_INACTIVE`` --- the pin is forced inactive (compare match is ignored).
            - ``Timer.IC`` --- configure the timer in Input Capture mode.
            - ``Timer.ENC_A`` --- configure the timer in Encoder mode. The counter only changes when CH1 changes.
            - ``Timer.ENC_B`` --- configure the timer in Encoder mode. The counter only changes when CH2 changes.
            - ``Timer.ENC_AB`` --- configure the timer in Encoder mode. The counter changes when CH1 or CH2 changes.

          - ``callback`` - as per TimerChannel.callback()

          - ``pin`` None (the default) or a Pin object. If specified (and not None)
            this will cause the alternate function of the the indicated pin
            to be configured for this timer channel. An error will be raised if
            the pin doesn't support any alternate functions for this timer channel.

        Keyword arguments for Timer.PWM modes:

          - ``pulse_width`` - determines the initial pulse width value to use.
          - ``pulse_width_percent`` - determines the initial pulse width percentage to use.

        Keyword arguments for Timer.OC modes:

          - ``compare`` - determines the initial value of the compare register.

          - ``polarity`` can be one of:

            - ``Timer.HIGH`` - output is active high
            - ``Timer.LOW`` - output is active low

        Optional keyword arguments for Timer.IC modes:

          - ``polarity`` can be one of:

            - ``Timer.RISING`` - captures on rising edge.
            - ``Timer.FALLING`` - captures on falling edge.
            - ``Timer.BOTH`` - captures on both edges.

          Note that capture only works on the primary channel, and not on the
          complimentary channels.

        Notes for Timer.ENC modes:

          - Requires 2 pins, so one or both pins will need to be configured to use
            the appropriate timer AF using the Pin API.
          - Read the encoder value using the timer.counter() method.
          - Only works on CH1 and CH2 (and not on CH1N or CH2N)
          - The channel number is ignored when setting the encoder mode.

            (``prescaler + 1``) to arrive at the timer clock. Timers 2-7 and 12-14
            have a clock source of 84 MHz (pyb.freq()[2] * 2), and Timers 1, and 8-11
            have a clock source of 168 MHz (pyb.freq()[3] * 2).

          - ``period`` [0-0xffff] for timers 1, 3, 4, and 6-15. [0-0x3fffffff] for timers 2 & 5.
            Specifies the value to be loaded into the timer's AutoReload
            Register (ARR). This determines the period of the timer (i.e. when the
            counter cycles). The timer counter will roll-over after ``period + 1``
            timer clock cycles.

    The maximum frequency of hclk is 168MHz, of pclk1 is 42MHz, and of pclk2 is
    84MHz.  Be sure not to set frequencies above these values.

    The hclk, pclk1 and pclk2 frequencies are derived from the sysclk frequency

    4, 8.  A prescaler will be chosen to best match the requested frequency.

    A sysclk frequency of
    8MHz uses the HSE (external crystal) directly and 16MHz uses the HSI
    (internal oscillator) directly.  The higher frequencies use the HSE to
    drive the PLL (phase locked loop), and then use the output of the PLL.

    Note that if you change the frequency while the USB is enabled then
    the USB may become unreliable.  It is best to change the frequency
    in boot.py, before the USB peripheral is started.  Also note that sysclk
    frequencies below 36MHz do not allow the USB to function correctly.

    """
    If called with no arguments, return the current USB mode as a string.

    If called with *modestr* provided, attempts to configure the USB mode.
    The following values of *modestr* are understood:

    - ``None``: disables USB
    - ``'VCP'``: enable with VCP (Virtual COM Port) interface
    - ``'MSC'``: enable with MSC (mass storage device class) interface
    - ``'VCP+MSC'``: enable with VCP and MSC
    - ``'VCP+HID'``: enable with VCP and HID (human interface device)
    - ``'VCP+MSC+HID'``: enabled with VCP, MSC and HID (only available on PYBD boards)

    For backwards compatibility, ``'CDC'`` is understood to mean
    ``'VCP'`` (and similarly for ``'CDC+MSC'`` and ``'CDC+HID'``).

    The *port* parameter should be an integer (0, 1, ...) and selects which
    USB port to use if the board supports multiple ports.  A value of -1 uses
    the default or automatically selected port.

    The *vid* and *pid* parameters allow you to specify the VID (vendor id)
    and PID (product id).  A *pid* value of -1 will select a PID based on the
    value of *modestr*.

    If enabling MSC mode, the *msc* parameter can be used to specify a list
    of SCSI LUNs to expose on the mass storage interface.  For example
    ``msc=(pyb.Flash(), pyb.SDCard())``.

    If enabling HID mode, you may also specify the HID details by
    passing the *hid* keyword parameter.  It takes a tuple of
    (subclass, protocol, max packet length, polling interval, report
    descriptor).  By default it will set appropriate values for a USB
    mouse.  There is also a ``pyb.hid_keyboard`` constant, which is an
    appropriate tuple for a USB keyboard.

    The *high_speed* parameter, when set to ``True``, enables USB HS mode if
    it is supported by the hardware.

    occurs once every millisecond (1000Hz) so this function will block for
    at most 1ms.
